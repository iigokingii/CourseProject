Hey!
his is my Spring MVC course project for movie selection based on Spring Boot, using Java Spring Security based on jwt token which is placed and stored in client's cookie. An Oracle database was used to store the data. All data access was carried out through stored functions and procedures written in pl/sql. Nested tables were developed and used.
